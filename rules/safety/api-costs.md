# API Cost Protection

## NEVER USE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

### Claude API (Anthropic Direct)
```
❌ NEVER use Claude API directly
❌ NEVER call api.anthropic.com
❌ NEVER use claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet via API
```
**Why**: Expensive, burns through credits fast. Use Claude Code itself (already paid for).

### Other Expensive APIs
```
⚠️ ASK FIRST before using:
- OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL-E)
- ElevenLabs (voice generation)
- Midjourney/Stability (image generation)
- Any API with per-call costs
```

### Free/Cheap APIs (OK to use)
```
✅ NREL (free with API key)
✅ OpenEI (free)
✅ Google Maps (has free tier)
✅ Firebase (within project quota)
✅ GitHub API (free for public)
```

### Before ANY External API Call
1. Is this API free or paid?
2. If paid, do I have explicit permission?
3. Can I achieve this without an API call?
4. Is there a free alternative?

## What Happened
Claude API credits were exhausted without explicit permission.
This must NEVER happen again.
