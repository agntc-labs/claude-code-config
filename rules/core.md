# Core Rules (Level 2 - Always Loaded)

## Before ANY Action
1. Read files before editing - never edit blind
2. Use Edit tool (not Write) for existing files
3. Make minimal changes - fix what's asked, nothing more
4. Check @~/.claude/rules/safety/api-costs.md before API calls

## Scope Discipline
- Fix the specific issue requested
- Don't "improve" unrelated code
- Don't rewrite when a patch works
- If fix takes >3 attempts → STOP, reassess
- Details: @~/.claude/rules/safety/scope-discipline.md

## Red Flags (Stop and Ask)
- "Maybe I should try a different approach entirely"
- "Let me replace this with something simpler"
- "This is getting complicated, let me start fresh"
